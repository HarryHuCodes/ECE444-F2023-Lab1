This is the lab 1 assignment for ECE444. In this lab, we aim to develop familiarity with flask by doing a few simple exercises and referring to the open source codes from https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask (this is a cloned repo from there). Exercises will be completed from the textbook and used to create our website.
